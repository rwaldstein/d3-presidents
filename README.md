# d3-presidents
A demo of d3 tree using US president data.
WHat is special: if a level has too many children for screen, makes
multiple rows reqiring no horizontal scrolling
# Data source
The data was extracted from the wikipedia pages on Presidents and some related pages.
E.g. "presidents pets".  Purely a demonstration set of data - not meant to be 
accurate or kept up to date
# About the demo
TO the best of my ability only have what is needed there.  WIth minimum of unexplained
numbers.  Let me know any that are not clear and I will attempt to make the 
code better explain the use

And can <a href="http://robert.waldste.in/programs/d3-presidents/presidents.html">see it in practice</a>.
# hoped for improvement
Wasn't happy about needing the up and down arrow - would prefer to do that as HTML constructs.
Hopefully will improve that in the near future, as time permits.  Was not
clear how to have HTML vs an image in the tree at that point though.
